# Burger-Shop-Server
The Burger Shop Server is a simple client-server application that simulates a burger shop. It allows multiple clients to connect and place orders for burgers, which are then prepared by chefs. Once all burgers are prepared, the server stops accepting new customers and shuts down gracefully.
